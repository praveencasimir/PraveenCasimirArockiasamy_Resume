# Locally

Before you start make sure you have Ruby and the gems for Jekyll installed locally. You can find out how to do that here.

Note: You will need version 1.15.2 of bundler, as this is the only version that Heroku supports.

Fork and or clone this repository locally
cd modern-resume-theme
bundle install
[bundle exec jekyll serve](http://127.0.0.1:4000)
Open your browser to `http://localhost:4000`
Any changes you make will automatically build and you will be able to see these by refreshing your browser. To find out more about Jekyll take a look here.

Note: You will need to re-run bundle exec jekyll serve to see changes made in _config.yml.
